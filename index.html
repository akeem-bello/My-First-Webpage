    Hello Akeem,

    Imagine giving your friend/family member â‚¦50,000 and saying "DO NOT GIVE ME BACK THIS MONEY FOR THE NEXT 60 DAYS,
    NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!". In 60 days you will be happy that you have â‚¦50,000 in your pocket. 
    Maybe if you had access to that money before you would have spent it recklessly right? This is what SAFELOCK on PiggyVest does for you.
    It is that friend that you can trust to lock your money for a period of time you preset. We'll break it down, no worries ðŸ™‚
    What is Safelock?
    This is a feature in PiggyVest that helps you lock funds that you don't want to be tempted to spend. The cool part is, 
    you can create as many Safelocks as you want or top-up an existing one and you also get upfront interest.
    How does the Safelock Interest work? The interest is paid UPFRONT. 
    You get between 6% - 13% per annum depending on how long you lock your funds for. 
    Your interest will be calculated automatically and paid immediately to your Flex wallet 
    which you can withdraw to your bank account anytime. Your funds will then be returned on the exact day you preset.
    How do you create Safelock?
    Login to your PiggyVest app.
    Click the "Savings" tab or "Total Savings" card.
    Click on the "Safelock" card.
    To create a Safelock, enter the amount, title, and set the lock duration.
    If you have any issues or questions, feel free to reach us via email contact@piggyvest.com or send us a message on our Twitter
